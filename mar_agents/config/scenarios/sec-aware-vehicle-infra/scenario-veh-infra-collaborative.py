"""
VEHICLE-INFRASTRUCTURE COLLABORATIVE SCENARIO

Infrastructure sensors capture data on the surrounding environment.
The agents obtain their own situational awareness
and pass their information to a command center that
unifies the information from all the agents.
The command center then passes the situational awareness
back to the mobile agents.
